Voice Noise Reduction
This Python script demonstrates a simple implementation of voice noise reduction using a thresholding technique. It utilizes the sounddevice, numpy, and noisereduce libraries to record audio, extract the voice component, apply noise reduction, and play back the original and processed audio.

Requirements
To run this code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

sounddevice
numpy
noisereduce
You can install these dependencies using pip by running the following command:

shell
Copy code
pip install sounddevice numpy noisereduce
Usage
Import the required libraries by including the following lines at the beginning of your Python script:
python
Copy code
import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np
import noisereduce as nr
Set the desired values for the constants used in the script. Modify the following lines according to your requirements:
python
Copy code
sample_rate = 44100  # Sample rate in Hz
duration = 5  # Duration of the recording in seconds
threshold = 0.02  # Threshold to distinguish voice from noise
Run the script. It will perform the following steps:

Record audio for the specified duration using the default input device.
Convert the recorded audio to mono.
Extract the voice component by applying a thresholding technique.
Apply noise reduction to the voice component using the noisereduce library.
Play back the original recorded audio.
Play back the audio after noise reduction.
Note: Ensure that you have a microphone or audio input device connected to your system for audio recording.

Observe the output in the console, which will display messages indicating the progress of audio recording and playback.

Customization
You can adjust the sample_rate constant to set the desired sample rate for audio recording and playback.
Modify the duration constant to specify the length of the recording in seconds.
Adjust the threshold value to fine-tune the distinction between voice and noise.
